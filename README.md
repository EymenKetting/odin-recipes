# odin-recipes
The core of this project will be: to build a website containing my favourite recipes and to demonstrate the skills I have acquired learning how to program HTML up until now.
I will have to demonstrate how to create a HTML boilerplate and how to fill in the rest of the code in order to create a well-functioning website.
